# Introduction: Git and GitHub, Part I

### See what you’ll be learning in the Git and GitHub, Part I Unit.

The goal of this unit is to introduce you to the Git versioning technology. Understanding Git is a crucial tool in your developer toolkit—but don’t worry if it doesn’t stick right away! Practice is crucial with Git, which is why we’re introducing it early in the Path. Additionally, you’ll understand how to take the repositories on your computer and put them online with GitHub. Having your work on Github will be important when you apply for jobs, and crucial to that will be having a solid README.md, which you’ll write with markdown.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Version control projects using Git
- Backtrack in Git
- Host a codebase online using GitHub repositories
- Use markdown to author a good README.md file

You will put all of this knowledge into practice with an upcoming Portfolio Project. You can complete the Portfolio Project either in parallel with or after taking the prerequisite content—it’s up to you!
